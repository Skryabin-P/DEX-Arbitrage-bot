Uniswap v3 supports creating multiple pools of the same pair with varying fee tiers, v3 factory has a getPool function,
taking two addresses and a fee. As opposed getPair which takes only the two addresses.
The v3 pools use the token balances, which you can get by calling balanceOf on each token in the pair and passing the address of the pool.
The mechanics across those two versions of the protocol vary quite a lot, so there isn't parity between most of the functions.
